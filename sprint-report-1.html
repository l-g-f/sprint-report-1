        <h3>Progress Description</h3>
        <p>We had a brief meeting on Oct 28 after the class. 
        Team members got a chance to meet each other and  aligned the subsequent meeting date and time.
        Between then and our next meeting, all team members accepted the invite via Github classroom,
        cloned the repository to our Cloud 9 accounts, and got set up in ZenHub. 
        </p>
        On Nov 1st, we had a Zoom meeting to ensure all team members were able to get the starter code running 
        and that ZenHub was working and updating as expected. We then spent time clarifying the project requirements, 
        generating user stories, and sorting some into the product and sprint backlog. We split additional tasks between ourselves too, including adding detail to user stories, building a template for sprint reports, and writing sprint reports. 
        
        </p>
        <p>
        Since we didn’t have any “yesterday’s weather” to base our sprint on, 
        we just guessed what would be a reasonable amount to accomplish for this sprint. 
        The stories we were able to complete were adding a logo to our site and adding a CSS framework to the starter code we were given. 
        We were able to complete the code changes and push them to our Github repo.
        There were a few more stories in our sprint backlog that we weren't able to get to.
        We expect in future sprints we’ll be able to better estimate how many story points we can build, 
        and hope as we gain experience and momentum we will be able to build more in a week than we will this week. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We plan to hold another meeting soon to more formally divide up user stories to be built over the course of the week, and to make more progress!    
        </p>

        <h3>Sprint 1 Backlog</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Build “create event” page and functionality</li>
            <li>Make an “about” page</li>
            <li>Title the site</li>
            <li>Add “about” and “home” buttons to the footer of each page</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            These were the remaining items that we had identified to have the biggest value add per time required to build during this sprint. They will be transferred to the backlog for the upcoming sprint.

        <h3>Product Backlog</h3>
